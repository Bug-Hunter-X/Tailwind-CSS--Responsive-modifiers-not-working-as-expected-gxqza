# Tailwind CSS: Responsive modifiers not working as expected

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered while using Tailwind CSS responsive modifiers.  The issue involves unexpected behavior when applying responsive modifiers to specific components, particularly when nested within other components or when using certain modifiers in conjunction.

## Bug Description
Responsive modifiers like `md:`, `lg:`, etc., are not correctly applying styles in certain cases, leading to inconsistent rendering across different screen sizes. This issue is not consistently reproducible and appears to be related to the specific component structure and the combination of Tailwind classes used.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server. 
4. Observe the behavior of the components in the application across different screen sizes. Note the inconsistencies in styling.

## Solution
The provided `bugSolution.js` file contains the corrected code. The primary issue is fixed by reorganizing the component structure and using a different approach for applying the styles. In particular, ensuring proper nesting and explicitly targeting elements with responsive classes helped resolve the inconsistencies.
